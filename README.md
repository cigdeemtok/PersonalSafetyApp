# PersonalSafetyApp
This is my graduation project that is an Android Kotlin app. This project aims to enable individuals to easily reach out to their close ones when they feel unsafe. It aims to ensure the safety of our loved ones living alone and monitor their health. This will be achieved through functionality involving real-time location sharing.
